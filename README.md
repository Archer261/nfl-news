# Touchdown Daily

Touchdown Daily is an aggregate NFL News website where the user can read and save articles about their favorite NFL team from multiple news sources all in one place. The sports news landscape is currently oversaturated with fluff. We wanted to create this website to solve the problem of continuously searching for NFL articles that are relevant to our favorite team. This website saves us time by compiling all the articles relevant to our favorite team into one place from multiple news sources.

## Challenges and Future Development

We ran into issues trying to integrate every part of the MVC. We also ran into an issue with getting our API's information to render on the page but that was debugged.

For future development we would like to beef up the user profile. One example is we want to add a ranking system that will rank the user on how many articles they have read. We also want to allow the user to personalize their profile and upload a profile picture. In addition we want the user to be able to choose a favorite team so we can prepopulate the main page with articles relevant to their favorite team.

Other future development plans are adding more news sources (we are currently only pulling from ESPN). We also want to develop sister sites for other sports such as basketball and baseball.
